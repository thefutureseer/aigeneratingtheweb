The number of people required to generate websites with AI will depend on several factors, such as the complexity of the website, the level of customization required, and the capabilities of the AI website generator tool being used. 

In general, AI website generators can significantly reduce the amount of human labor required to create a website. With an AI website generator, a single person can create a functional and visually appealing website in a relatively short amount of time. However, depending on the needs of the project, additional personnel may be required to handle tasks such as content creation, graphic design, and user experience testing.

For example, a small business owner with basic website needs may be able to generate a simple website using an AI website generator tool without the need for additional personnel. However, a larger organization with more complex website needs, such as an e-commerce platform or a website that requires extensive customization, may require a team of developers, designers, and content creators to ensure that the website meets their needs and is user-friendly. 

Ultimately, the number of people required to generate websites with AI will depend on the specific needs of the project and the resources available to the organization or individual.
